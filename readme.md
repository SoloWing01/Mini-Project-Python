📁 Project 1: Alphabet Matrix Generator
📝 Description

This is a beginner-friendly Python mini project that demonstrates basic logic building using:

String manipulation

2D lists (list of lists)

Nested loops

Given a word (e.g., cbg), the program constructs a 2D list (matrix) where each row contains all lowercase alphabets from 'a' up to the corresponding character in the word.

💡 Example

If the input word is:

cbg


The output matrix will be:

['a', 'b', 'c']
['a', 'b']
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']


Each sublist shows the path of alphabets from 'a' to the target letter.

🔍 Concepts Used

For loops

String iteration

ASCII lowercase letters (string.ascii_lowercase)

2D lists

Conditional breaks

Git basics (commit, push)

🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the script with:

python main.py


(or whatever your file is named)

🧠 Learning Outcome

This project is useful for beginners to:

Understand how 2D lists are built dynamically

Practice working with loops and conditionals

Learn about string and list operations

Get hands-on experience with Git/GitHub version control
